# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first post using **Hugo** with the beautiful [Stack theme](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack). 

## Features of the Stack Theme

The Stack theme offers many great features:

- **Card-style design** - Clean and modern layout
- **Responsive design** - Works great on mobile and desktop
- **Fast performance** - Optimized for speed
- **Search functionality** - Built-in search capabilities
- **Archive organization** - Easy content organization
- **Syntax highlighting** - Great for code snippets

## Code Example

Here's a sample code block with syntax highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Welcome to my blog!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    message = hello_world()
    print(message)
```

## Getting Started

To create new posts, you can use Hugo's built-in commands:

```bash
hugo new post/my-new-post.md
```

Then edit the created file and start writing your content in Markdown!
