I started watching the [Foundation series](https://share.google/zbjcL9MdWh9Wuu2Vs) recently, and it made me think - if I had years and years to ponder and select the things to store, that would guide a future civilization - what pieces would I include? Since I have spent a few years working in the field of machine learning, I thought I would start there. It also gives me an excuse to ponder/question/re-visit assumptions/analyze/debate the foundations (see what I did there?) of my own knowledge, and that present in my current information bubble.
